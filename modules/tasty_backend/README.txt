Tasty Backend provides a ready made administration experience for day-to-day content administrators.

Most admin users won't, and shouldn't, have full access to the Drupal administration backend. They need to
concentrate on tasks like adding and managing content, taxonomies, menus, and possibly other users. They do
not need access to configure views, install/configure modules, or any other full administration privileges.

Tasty Backend includes user roles, administrations screens, menus and more to provide an easy to use, and
simplified, administration experience. This is completely separate from the usual menus and administration
screens provided by default, which are more useful for site builders and other users who are actively
developing the site.

While there are many changes in the Drupal 8 Tasty Backend, the following video from DrupalCon Amsterdam
discusses some of the use cases, reasons behind the project, and demonstrates similar functionality from
the Drupal 7 version:
